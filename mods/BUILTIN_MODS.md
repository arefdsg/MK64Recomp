# Built-in Mods

This folder contains mods that are built into the Zelda 64: Recompiled project. Built-in mods behave like normal mods but are present in a clean installation of the project. They can be updated or downgraded by placing the .nrm file for the mod in the appdata mods folder in the same way a normal mod would be, which overrides the built-in version with the manually installed version.

The list of built-in mods is as follows:
